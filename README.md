This project is part of the coursera programming assignment for the course "Getting and Cleaning Data". In this project, "UCI HAR Dataset" folder contain the data which needs to be cleaned up. The script run_analysis.R does the cleanup of the data as is asked in the programming assignment. 
There are comments in this script to make the script self explanatory. This script does the following:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
